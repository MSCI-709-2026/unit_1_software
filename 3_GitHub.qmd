### Unit 1: Getting Started

#### Lesson 1: Introduction to Git and GitHub

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### What is version control?

Version control allows you to keep track of your work and helps you to easily explore the changes you have made, be it data, coding scripts, notes, etc. You are probably already doing some type of version control, if you save multiple files, such as `Dissertation_script_25thFeb.R`, `Dissertation_script_26thFeb.R`, etc. This approach will leave you with tens or hundreds of similar files, making it rather cumbersome to directly compare different versions, and is not easy to share among collaborators. With version control software such as Git, version control is much smoother and easier to implement. Using an online platform like Github to store your files means that you have an online backup of your work, which is beneficial for both you and your collaborators.

Git has a tremendous amount of uses, and you can use the command line to perform advanced actions. However, in this class we will just be using Git's more basic functions. This is a gentle introduction to syncing Positron and Github, so you can start using version control in minutes.

### What are the benefits of using version control?

Having a GitHub repo makes it easy for you to keep track of collaborative and personal projects - all files necessary for certain analyses can be held together and people can add in their code, graphs, etc. as the projects develop. Each file on GitHub has a history, making it easy to explore the changes that occurred to it at different time points. You can review other people's code, add comments to certain lines or the overall document, and suggest changes. For collaborative projects, GitHub allows you to assign tasks to different users, making it clear who is responsible for which part of the analysis. You can also ask certain users to review your code. For personal projects, version control allows you to keep track of your work and easily navigate among the many versions of the files you create, whilst also maintaining an online backup.

### How to get started

First, please register on the Github website:

<https://github.com/>

The files you put on GitHub are public by default (i.e. everyone can see them & suggest changes, but only the people with access to the repository can directly edit and add/remove files). You can also have private repositories on GitHub, which means that only you can see the files. As a student, you can upgrade your GitHub profile to a higher tier for free if you apply for the education benefit: <https://github.com/settings/education/benefits>

Note that most GitHub users that want to contribute code to GitHub (like you) need 2 factor authentication. I use Duo's free tier: <https://duo.com/editions-and-pricing/duo-free>, but you should use whatever you prefer. More info on 2FA and GitHub is available here: <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/about-mandatory-two-factor-authentication>

### Download and install Git on your computer:

At the heart of GitHub is an open source version control system (VCS) called Git. Git is responsible for everything GitHub-related that happens locally on your computer. Git can be used through command line or through a downloaded GUI (Graphical User Interface) such as GitHub Desktop. However, in this class we'll be using Positron's built-in integration with Git.

Go here to download and install Git: <https://git-scm.com/downloads>

Here are instructions on installation, but please note that these may not be completely up to date. It's better to consult the software distributor directly for current instructions and troubleshooting.

#### For Windows machines:

Download and install Git for your operating system. Below are some recommended installation instructions, to keep things simple. However, if you know what these options do, and want to change them to suit you, go ahead:

-   For "Select Components", check:
    -   "Git Bash Here"
    -   "Git GUI Here"
    -   "Git LFS (Large File Support)"
    -   "Associate .git\* ..."
    -   "Associate .sh ..."
-   When prompted to choose the default editor, pick Nano (a simple terminal editor) or Notepad++ (a simple graphical editor):
-   For "Adjust your PATH environment", select: "Use Git from Git Bash only"
-   For "Choose HTTPS transport backend", select: "Use the OpenSSL library"
-   For "Configure the line ending conversions", select: "Checkout Windows-style,..."
-   For "Configure the terminal emulator ...", select: "Use MinTTY ..."
-   For "Configure extra options", select: "Enable file system caching"
-   "Enable Git Credential Manager"

#### For Mac machines:

Install Git via Homebrew, which is a package manager for command line programs on Mac. First, open a terminal, which can be found at `~/Application/Utilities/Terminal.app`. Then, copy and paste this line into the terminal and hit "Enter":

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"`

When homebrew is finished installing, enter the following to install Git:

`brew install git`

Follow any instructions in the terminal window, you may need to enter your Mac's password or agree to questions by typing yes.

### Set GitHub email and username on your local computer

The first thing you must do after you install Git is to associate it with your GitHub user name and email address. This is important because every Git push / pull uses this information. You only need to do this once if you pass the --global option, because then Git will always use that information for anything you do on that system. If you want to override this with a different name or email address for specific projects, you can run the command without the --global option when you’re in that project.

Do this by opening the shell on your computer. On a Mac computer, go to `Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal` which will open up your default command line interface (probably `bash` or `zsh`). On a Windows machine, open up `Git Bash` (you can find it by going to your Start Menu and typing `Git Bash` into the search bar and clicking on it). **Another way for Mac or Windows users to open their shell is through Positron.** In the lower-center pane of Positron, switch from the `Console` tab to the `Terminal` tab. This is equivalent to the Mac Terminal, and on Windows, once Git is installed, this should default to the Git Bash Shell. Note that if you have been rendering quarto docs (you'll learn what that means later) you may need to toggle away from the `Quarto Preview` view of the `Terminal` tab back to the `bash` shell view of the `Terminal` tab. You'll see the option to do so just to the right of the pane.

![](doc/positron_terminal.png)

Then, at the prompt in your shell, type in the following code. Note that `your_email@example.com` should be the email address that you used to set up your GitHub account. In the second command, the GitHub username should be the same as the GitHub username that you chose when you created a profile on GitHub.com, and it will be surrounded in double quotation marks. In my case, my GitHub username is `eringutbrod` and so my GitHub profile page is <https://github.com/eringutbrod>.

**Copy the following code into the shell:**

```         
git config --global user.email your_email@example.com
# Use the email with which you registered on GitHub and click Enter

git config --global user.name "Your GitHub Username"
# Add your username in double quotes and click Enter
```

If you have a Windows computer, type the following to turn off this annoying feature where Windows can't handle filenames from git if there are too many characters in the filename:

```         
git config --global core.longpaths true
```

That's it! If you are interested in double checking your `Git` settings, you can type in the following command into your shell:

```         
git config --list
```

If you don't like your settings and want to change them, you can just repeat the commands above to update your email or your user name.

### Generate a Personal Access Token

To transfer material like scripts and programming notebooks between an IDE like Positron and your GitHub account, you need to authorize access between Positron and GitHub. With VS Code (the base of Positron) most of this authorization is handled by OAuth, which means you don't have to do anything special but Positron may prompt you to input your GitHub username and password when you communicate with GitHub. But in some cases, you may need to generate a Personal Access Token. This is like a password, but long and random, and therefore more secure. To generate a Personal Access Token, follow the directions here:

<https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token>

In short:

-   Go to your GitHub profile page.
-   Click your profile photo in the upper-right corner of the page and click `Settings`.
-   In the left side bar, click `Developer Settings`.
-   In the left sidebar, click `Personal access tokens` -\> `Tokens (classic)`
-   On the top right, click `Generate new token` -\> `Generate new token (classic)`
-   Add a note. This can be anything, but I would write something like `PAT-2026-01-15`
-   Set the Expiration period for this personal access token. I generated a token with no expiration date because I'm super lazy about cyber security. Once your expiration period has ended, you'll have to go through these steps to generate a new personal access token.
-   Select the scopes of permission for this personal access token. At least choose `repo` for this class.
-   Click `Generate Token`
-   Copy the personal access token that has been generated. You can email this to yourself, save it in a Word file on your computer, or put it anywhere that will be handy for your workflow. You will need to copy and paste this in the future to move your files onto GitHub!
-   Note that on your personal access token page on GitHub, you can revoke all tokens that you have generated if you are concerned that someone has gained access to your account.

If you choose to generate a personal access token with an expiration date, you'll need to generate a new personal access token whenever your old token expires. When you have a new personal access token, you can set that token in Positron using the library `gitcreds`. When you run the function `gitcreds_set()`, you will be given the option to replace your GitHub security credentials. Select this option (option 2) then paste in the new personal access token. All done!

``` r
install.packages("gitcreds") # Only do this once
library(gitcreds)
gitcreds_set() # sets your git credentials

gitcreds_get() # to check your git credentials
gitcreds_get()$password # to see the actual password
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The basics of version control with Git

#### What is a repository?

You can think of a repository (aka a repo) as a "master folder", everything associated with a specific project should be kept in a repo for that project. Repos can have folders within them to keep your project files organized.

You will have a local copy (on your computer) and an online copy (on GitHub) of all the files (or the subset you choose) in the repository.

#### The workflow

The GitHub workflow can be summarised by the "stage-commit-pull-push" mantra.

1.  Stage
    -   Once you've created, deleted, or edited and saved files in your repo, and you decide that you want to save these changes as a new "version" of your project, you must stage all of the files whose updates should be included in this new version. This step is really just selecting the files that you want to commit (see next step). Note there is no need to stage files that have not been changed since the previous version of your project was committed.
2.  Commit
    -   Once you've staged the updated files in your repo, you need to commit them - this means the changes you have made to files in your repo will be saved as a version of the repo, and your changes are now ready to be loaded onGitHub (the online copy of the repository).
3.  Pull
    -   Now, before you send your changes to Github, you need to pull, i.e. make sure you are completely up to date with the latest version of the online version of the files - other people could have been working on them even if you haven't.
4.  Push
    -   Once you are up to date, you can push your changes - at this point in time your local copy and the online copy of the files will be the same.

Each file on GitHub has a history, so instead of having many files like Dissertation_1st_May.R, Dissertation_2nd_May.R, you can have only one and by exploring its history, you can see what it looked at different points in time.

### Create your own GitHub repository and Positron workspace

To make a repository, go to your Repositories page on your GitHub profile. Select `New`.... Repositories/New repository - choose a concise and informative name that has no spaces or funky characters in it. For today, a good name could be `hello_world`. Eventually you'll want to build a repo that holds together past and ongoing research, data, scripts, figures, tables and manuscripts for a specific project. Later on you might want to have more repositories - e.g. a repository associated with each project that you want version control for, or a public project where you are actively seeking feedback from a wider audience.

Click the check boxes to Initialize repo with a README.md file and a .gitignore file. Add a .gitignore template. Search in the template options for the `R` template since we are primarily coding in R. Then click `Create Repository`.

#### README file

It's common practice for each repository to have a README.md file, which contains information about the project, the purpose of the repository, as well as any comments on licensing and data sources. Github understands several text formats, including .txt and .md. .md stands for a file written in Markdown, which is essentially just the plain markup language that we use in Quarto files, except without the functionality to read R code.

You can directly edit your README.md file on Github by clicking on the file and then selecting Edit this file (the little pencil icon). It's a good idea to write an informative README.md file for your repository. Just like with RMarkdown, to make headings and subheadings, put hashtags before a line of text - the more hashtags, the smaller the heading will appear. You can make lists using - and numbers 1, 2, 3, etc.. Here are some things you might want to consider including in a README file:

-   Your name
-   Project title
-   Links to website & social media
-   Contact details
-   Any instructions relevant to others that may want to use your repo

Go to the repository page for the repository you just made. Scroll down and you'll see your README.md file displayed at the bottom of the page. Click the pencil in the upper right-hand corner of the README file to edit the file directly on GitHub. Add your name, the date and a short description. When you are done, scroll to the bottom and click `Commit changes` to save the changes you made to the README file to the master branch of your repository.

#### Edit your .gitignore file

Repositories often have a file called `.gitignore`. The period at the beginning of the file name indicates that this will be a hidden file on your local computer. In this file you specify which files you want Git to ignore when users make changes and add files. So these are the kinds of files that you do NOT want to have stored on your GitHub repo. Examples include temporary Word, Excel and Powerpoint files, .Rhist files, etc. Some files might get saved on your local repository (i.e. on your computer), but not online as they might be too big to store online.

We initialized the repo with a .gitignore file template designed for R programmers. If you didn't initialize the repo with a .gitignore file, you could go to your repo and Create new file and write a .gitignore file within your main repository (not within any folders). You would need to call the file .gitignore and then add the types of files that Git should ignore on separate lines.

Go to your repo and click on the .gitignore file and then click the edit pencil in the upper right-hand corner. You can keep the R template file exactly as it is, or you can make changes to the .gitignore file that are specific to your needs. This is what I've been using recently to exclude other types of files unrelated to R (such as temporary Microsoft Office files) that I might want to exclude from me repo. Feel free to copy and paste this into your own .gitignore file:

```         
# Prevent users to commit their own .RData and .Rhistory in mutual area
.RData
.Rhistory
.Rapp.history
# Temporary files
*~
~$*.doc*
~$*.xls*
*.xlk
~$*.ppt*
# Prevent mac users to commit .DS_Store files
*.DS_Store
```

You can go back to edit your .gitignore file by clicking on it in the repo and then clicking the edit button any time. After making edits, don't forget to commit them (save them) to your repo.

#### Create folders

Determine what your repository will contain - some examples include: manuscripts, data, figures, scripts, notes, etc. To make a new folder, go to your repo and click on the big plus `+` sign, and `Create new file` and add in the name of your new folder followed by a slash, e.g. `data/` before the name of the first file you want to put in the folder. It's always a good idea to create a README file, so you can call the file name `README.md` and then put some text in the Markdown file such as "The data folder contains raw data associated with this research". When creating folders within your repo through GitHub's website, you always need to make at least one file associated with them, you can't just create an empty folder, so the README file also serves this need. Add a brief explanation of what the folder is for in the README.md file, scroll down and click on the green `Commit new file` button. Add a quick message where it says Create README.md file in light grey text.

### Sync and interact with your repository through Positron

The "commit-pull-push" workflow can be embedded within Positron using GitHub-linked "workspaces". On GitHub, navigate to the "hello_world" repository you just created.

Click the green download (indicated as an arrow pointing down) `Code` button and copy the HTTPS link:

![](doc/GitHub_Clone_Screenshot.png)

Now open Positron, click `File -> New Folder from Git...` and paste the HTTPS link from the Github repository into the `Git Repository URL` field. Select a directory on your computer - that is where the "local" copy of your repository will be (whereas the online version of your repo is on Github). Then I usually check the box to open in a new window. I think it's easiest to stay organized to have a separate Positron window open for every GitHub repo you are actively working in.

Once the files have finished copying across (this may take a while depending on the size of the repo you're joining), you can access git version control to stage, commit, pull and push GitHub using the `Source Control` menu in the left-side tool bar:

![](doc/git_positron_integration.png)

You are now ready to start making changes and documenting them through Github! Note that you can't push empty folders.

You can open some of the files you made online earlier - for example if you click on your `README.md` file by searching for it in the `Explorer` menu on the left-side tool bar, you can open it and make changes to the local copy on your computer. Add some more text, such as the date that you created this repo, just for the sake of exemplifying how version control works. Save the changes you made to your file in the usual way `File -> Save`.

You can also create new files. Within `Positron`, go to `File -> New file -> R File` and create a new R script file. Write a comment or command in your `.R` file. Save your `.R` file with any name you like (I chose `hello_world.R`).

Now we are going to get the changes you made on the local copy of your README file and your new `.R` file synced up with the online copy on GitHub. You can do all of this through the `Source Control` pane accessed from the left-side tool bar. Under `Changes` you should see a list of all changes made to the repo since it was cloned onto your local computer. You may need to click the `Refresh` button, which looks like a curly arrow, to get `Positron` to look for these changes. In my case, I see an `M` next to the README.md file because I `modified` the file, and I see a `U` next to the `hello_world.R` script which means that it is an `untracked` file (i.e. I added it to the directory, but it's not a file that has been designated yet as part of the repo). I want to `Stage` both of these files, so that I can commit, push, and pull the changes to the GitHub repo. I will use the `+` next to each file to stage them individually, or hover over the `Changes` bar and click the `+` button there to `Stage` all changes at the same time. You'll see the files have been moved under a new heading called `Staged changes`, and the script now has `A` next to it to indicate that it is ready to be added to the repo. If we had deleted a file from the repo in our local directory, there would be a `D` next to it for a deleted file. If there are changes that you made in your local repo that you don't want to track with git or push out to the GitHub repo, just don't click the `+` to `Stage` those files.

Once you have `Staged` the files that you want to commit to the GitHub repository, it's time to `Commit` those changes so that they are tracked with your git version control software. All commits must have a `Commit Message`. Put a short, simple, informative message in the `Commit Message` box, like "added a new script", then click on the `Commit` button. If you don't include a message, a new tab will pop up above your `Console` pane reminding you that you need a commit message. If that happens, click out of that new pop up tab, then add your commit message and click `Commit` again.

You may notice the `Graph` panel in the lower part of the `Source Control` pane has updated, reflecting changes to the timeline of the repo. A nice feature with git is looking at the `diff` of your staged or committed files. For example click on the `README.md` file that you committed in the `Graph` panel and you will see a `diff` view pop up in the center pane showing new text added since the previous commit in green, and old text that has been deleted since the previous commit in red.

Now that the changes in your repo have been `Staged` and `Committed`, it's time to pull any new changes down from your GitHub repo, then push these changes you made on your local computer out to the GitHub repo. Even though git users usually think of this as two separate actions (pull then push), in Positron, you can do both of these at once by clicking `Sync Changes`. Note that if you wanted to do these actions one at a time, you could do so from the `...` drop down menu next to `Changes`. So click `Sync Changes`, which will generate a pop-up window warning me that this will pull then push, press `OK`, and you are done!

The reason `Positron` bundled the `pull` and `push` actions into a single button is because it's important to **always `Pull` before you `Push`.** `Pull` means that you are retrieving the most recent version of the Github repository onto your local branch - this command is especially useful if several people are working within the same repository - imagine there was another version of your R script because your collaborator was working on it the same time as you - you wouldn't want to "overwrite" their work and cause trouble. In this case, you are the only one working on these files, but it's still good to develop the practice of pulling before you push.

Go back to your repository on Github, where you can now see all of your updated files online. Click on your README file on GitHub and then on `History` - this is where you can see the different versions of your script - obviously in real life situations you will make many changes as your work progresses - here we just have two. Thanks to Github and version control, you don't need to save hundreds of almost identical files (e.g. `Dissertation_script_25thFeb.R`, `Dissertation_script_26thFeb.R`) - you have one file and by clicking on the different commits, you can see what it looked like at different points in time.

**You are now ready to add your scripts, plots, data files, etc. to your new workspace directory and follow the same workflow as outlined above - stage your files, commit, pull, push.** If you have already created some files (scripts, documentation, etc.) for a new repo, go ahead and copy them into your project folder (what `Positron` calls a `workspace`) that you tied to the repository on GitHub. Otherwise, start creating new files and write your code, produce figures, draft papers, etc. and make sure you are saving them in your project folder. Whenever a file is added to this folder or updated inside of this folder, you'll see it appear under `Changes` in the `Source Control` pane in `Positron`. At reasonable intervals, or whenever you get something accomplished, make sure that you stage, commit, pull and push those new files or new changes out to the main branch of your repository in GitHub.

#### XKCD on Git commit messages:

### Using files on someone else's public GitHub

Now that you can create your own repository (project) from scratch on GitHub, it's time to learn how to use some of the data, models and materials that's already available in other peoples' repositories. You can grab someone else's GitHub repo, work with it in Positron, and push it back onto GitHub.

Let's say you found some data/models/ etc. on GitHub that's part of a public repository owned by a person you don't know. That person has a public repo because they want people to have access to their work. It is useful to pull files from this existing repo into our own github profile. Then we can work with it in Positron and send out our changes to our own copy of this repository on our own GitHub repository.

This is especially relevant for our class, because **I will created tutorials and code for each of the class modules and I will host them in repositories on GitHub:** <https://github.com/MSCI-709-2026>

This type of work flow requires the following steps:

-   FORK (or copy) an existing public repository to your own profile
-   CLONE your new online repository to your local computer
-   STAGE / COMMIT / PULL / PUSH your edits between the local and remote repos

This is just like the process we just did with our hello world repo, except that we are FORKing an existing repository instead of creating one from scratch.

#### FORK

As you can imagine, people you don't know usually don't want you to be able to update their files without them knowing it. That's why you can't actually change a file in a "master branch" unless you've been added as a collaborator by the "owner". So instead of using and changing their original files, you need to `Fork` their repo first. This essentially makes a copy of all information in their repo, and stores it as your own.

Go to the course GitHub page <https://github.com/MSCI-709-2026> and Fork the first module `unit_1_software` to your own GitHub profile:

-   Go to the course GitHub page <https://github.com/MSCI-709-2026>
-   Click on the `unit_1_software` repo
-   Press 'Fork' in the top right corner
-   Now navigate back to your github account (if you click on your user picture in the top right, it'll bring down a menu where you can select "Your repositories"), and you'll see the forked repo exists in your world where you can mess with it

![](doc/github_fork_schematic.png){width="60%"}

#### CLONE

Once you've forked a repo into your own github, you probably want to start working with it in Positron. The easiest way is to get the repo URL from github, THEN create the corresponding folder using Positron that it'll communicate with. When you're in your forked repo that you want to work with:

-   Click on the green 'Code' button with the down arrow
-   Select and copy the entire URL (or click on the clipboard to the right of the URL)
-   Open Positron
-   Go to `File -> New Folder from Git... `
-   Paste the URL from github into the 'Git Repository URL' bar
-   Select the directory on your local computer where you want to save course files.
-   Select `Open in a new window`

Now, it kind of seems like you're back to working in a Positron workspace like normal, right? And all of the files that were in the repo you forked are now in your working directory. But we also have version control power now.

Let's make changes to our own copy of this course repo. Remember the Quarto tutorial in the last class where you created an example `.qmd` file? Or in the class before, did you create a `.R` script where you practiced making all of the different data types in R? Find those files on your computer and copy them over to your new `unit_1_software` repo on your local computer. You might want to append your initials to the end of the file name so that you know that this is material that YOU created during the class. That way, you also don't copy over any of the files that I created for you in this repo. Or you can simply go into one of the files, such as `doc/Qmd_Example.qmd` and make a change to it. Perhaps just add your initials to the top to say "EMG wuz here". Once you have made some changes to YOUR copy of the class repo, you want to save those changes and push them back out to GitHub. These changes will only exist in the forked version of this repo in your GitHub profile. Your edits will not be saved in the original class version of this repository.

#### STAGE / COMMIT / PULL / PUSH

Now that your workspace in Positron has been updated, we follow the process of Stage \> Commit \> Pull \> Push to send versions back to github. Once you've saved your .qmd (feel free to render, too), it shows up in your working directory. This process is exactly the same as what you did earlier when you created your own repo from scratch.

-   Click on the 'Source Control' tab in the left-side tool bar in Positron
-   Click `+` to stage the files you have changed 
-   Add a commit message
-   Click 'Commit'
-   Click 'Sync Changes' or 'Pull, Push' to send the commits back to github
-   Refresh your GitHub repo online, and see that the file(s) YOU created now exist in your repo. Cool! Cloud storage and version control!

## Course Workflow

Now that you are set up with GitHub and you have found our class GitHub organization: <https://github.com/MSCI-709-2026> you can follow the class coding tutorials very easily. Whenever we start a new unit, **you should fork the associated unit repo to your own GitHub profile and Clone it onto your local computer.** From there you have access to all of the files we use in the tutorial: data, scripts, figures, readings etc. During class, create your own `.R` or `.qmd` file and type the code along with me, but save the file with your initials at the end of the file name. That way you know that it's the versions that YOU created while you were following along with the course. You can take your own notes / comments directly in your `.R` or `.qmd` files and reference them later. You'll also have the original tutorials that I created for you to reference as well. Commit and push your changes back into your repo as you go.

When you are working, open up the `.qmd` file associated with the lesson tutorial that we are working through that day. Also open a new `.qmd` or `.R` file in the Positron workspace (i.e. local folder) linked to that unit's repo on your computer to type the code we are writing along with the tutorial. You can toggle between the R script that you are writing in Positron and the typed-up tutorial that you knitted from the `.qmd` file I created.

## Course homework workflow

I will send out a homework assignment URL for each assignment through GitHub Classroom. This will create a private repository that is just for your homework assignment where you can clone your private homework repo to your local computer, build your scripts / files, commit (save) your work, and push it back to your private homework repo that I have access to for grading. The first time you accept a homework assignment for this class, you'll receive a request to link your GitHub account to your name/email to the class roster. This is important because that's how I'll know how to relate the completed homework files to the student that submitted them. Once you have accepted your assignment (and once you have linked your GitHub account to our classroom) you'll interact with the homework template like a normal GitHub repository. Make changes to the file(s), add files and add data as needed to complete the assignment, then push your changes back out to GitHub through Positron before the deadline. Voila!

### Potential problems

Sometimes you will see error messages as you try to commit-pull-push. Usually the error message identifies the problem and which file it's associated with, if the message is more obscure, googling it is a good step towards solving the problem. Here are some potential problems that might arise:

#### Code conflicts

While you were working on a certain part of a script, someone else was working on it, too. When you go through commit-pull-push, GitHub will make you decide which version you want to keep. This is called a code conflict, and you can't proceed until you've resolved it. You will see arrows looking like `>>>>>>>>>` around the two versions of the code - delete the version of the code you don't want to keep, as well as the arrows, and your conflict should disappear.

#### Pushing the wrong files

If you accidentally push what you didn't intend to, deleted many things (or everything!) and then pushed empty folders, you can revert your commit. You can keep reverting until you reach the point in time when everything was okay. This is an easy way out if you're the only person working in the repository - **be aware that if there are other people that have committed to the repository, reverting will also undo all of their work, as reverting refers to the repository as a whole, not just your own work in it.**

Using these "undo" commands can be daunting, so make sure you read up on the different commands before you attempt anything that may delete work permanently: [here's a starter](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes/git-revert). It's a good idea to regularly back up your repository to an external hard drive *juuuust* in case!

### Collaborative coding in GitHub

So far, we've been the sole "author" on some repo/project we're working in. Occassionally, you may want to collaborate on a paper or data analysis. If that's the case, you'll want to add a collaborator.

**IMPORTANT: Collaborators will be able to push/pull changes directly to/from the repo you share with them, so make sure it's someone you want to allow!**

Once you have confirmed that you want to add someone as a collaborator:

-   Figure out what name or username or email they have associated with their github account
-   While in the github repo that you want to add them to as a collaborator, click on 'Settings'
-   In the left-hand menu, under 'Access' click 'Collaborators'
-   In the center of the page, click 'Add People'
-   Enter their GitHub username(s)
-   When you find the right one, click 'Add Collaborator'

Now your invited collaborators can clone and push/pull directly to this repository, and you can both work on the same project simultaneously.

#### Sync and interact with your repository through the command line

Traditionally, Git uses the command line to perform actions on local Git repositories. In this class we don't use the command line but it is necessary if you want more control over Git. There are several excellent introductory guides on version control using Git, e.g. [Prof Simon Mudd's Numeracy, Modelling and Data management guide](http://simon-m-mudd.github.io/NMDM_book/#_version_control_with_git), [The Software Carpentry guide](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/), and this [guide from the British Ecological Society Version Control workshop](https://github.com/BES2016Workshop/version-control). For more generic command line tools, look at this [general cheat sheet](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/command-line-cheat-sheet) and this [cheat sheet for mac users](https://github.com/0nn0/terminal-mac-cheatsheet). Here is a table and flow diagram with some basic Git commands and how they fit into the Git/Github workflow:

| Command | Origin | Destination | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| `git clone REPO_URL` | Personal Github | Local | Creates a local copy of a Github repo. The URL can be copied from Github.com by clicking the \`Clone or Download\` button. |
| `git add README.md` | Working Dir | Staging Area | Add "README.md" to staging area. |
| `git commit` | Staging Area | Local | Commits changes to files to the local repo. |
| `git commit -a` | Working Dir | Local | adds and commits all file changes to the local repo. |
| `git pull` | Personal Github | Local | Retrieve any changes from a Github repo. |
| `git push` | Local | Personal Github | Sends commited file changes to Github repo. |
| `git merge` | Other branch | Current branch | Merge any changes in the named branch with the current branch. |
| `git checkout -b patch1` | NA | NA | Create a branch called "patch1" from the current branch and switch to it. |
| `git init` | NA | NA | Initialise a directory as a Git repo. |
| `git log` | NA | NA | Display the commit history for the current repo |
| `git status` | NA | NA | See which files are staged/unstaged/changed |
| `git diff` | NA | NA | See the difference between staged uncomitted changes and the most recent commit |
| `git stash` | NA | NA | Save uncommitted changes in a temporary version and revert to the most recent commit |
